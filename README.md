# Project Tulip

_Project Tulip_ is an open-world 2D platformer game that I'm developing in my free time. It's inspired by Terraria.

I have a lot of different ideas for the game design and mechanics that I hope I'll be able to implement. I'm also paying special attention to the code architecture to keep everything organized and easy to extend upon existing features.
