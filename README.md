# Project Tulip

_Project Tulip_ ([play on itch.io](https://furkankambay.itch.io/tulip)) is an open-world 2D platformer game I'm developing in my free time. It's mainly inspired by Terraria, as well as other games I've played. It's very much work-in-progress and only serves as a portfolio piece for now.

In its current state, the game is just a few mechanics put together and doesn't have an actual game loop (yet). I'm working on making it an actual game slowly but surely...

## Design

I have a lot of ideas on the game design, systems, mechanics, quests, and more that I hope I'll be able to implement. I'm keeping the code architecture clean and extensible since I want to be able to extend the game easily. I have lots of private notes on the game that I might make into a public roadmap some day.

Planned: decent world generation, (better) enemy AI, quests, world structures, puzzles, bosses

## Art

The art direction is not finalized. I'm using placeholder assets that seem to go well enough together for the time being. Same with sounds and music. I made or modified some art assets myself using LibreSprite. I bought a MIDI keyboard which may not have been a smart investment, but surely I'll make some progress one day.
